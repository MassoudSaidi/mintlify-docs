**AI agent tools have exploded and most people are still guessing what to use when. So I started mapping out what each one is actually built for. **

If you're building anything beyond a demo, the tool you choose matters early.

Here’s a clear breakdown, depending on what you’re building.

▪️ If you need to chain tools and memory across steps → LangChain

Still the most flexible for logic-first workflows.

But the learning curve is real if you’re not used to designing agent state.

▪️ If you’re building teams of agents that pass tasks → CrewAI

Roles, memory and handoff logic baked in.

It works when you need structure, not just clever prompts.

▪️ If your agent needs to ask, refine, repeat → AutoGen

Great for tasks that evolve through feedback.

The agent learns more by asking than assuming.

▪️ If you want agents to behave like real dev teams → MetaGPT

You define a spec, and the PM, Dev, QA agents execute.

Useful when you need product thinking, not just code output.

▪️ If your task needs retries, state or conditional flows → LangGraph

This saved us time debugging long workflows.

Visual graphs help you spot logic loops fast.

▪️ If your agent is in production and failing silently → AgentOps

Dashboards, logs, alerts.

▪️ If you’re prototyping fast with your own APIs → Superagent

Open-source, vector DB, memory-ready.

Easy to fork and test something new in under an hour.

▪️ If you’re doing RAG with large docs or search flows → Haystack Agents

Dev-centric, tuned for retrieval pipelines.

It’s modular, and it’s built to go deep into documents, not wide.
