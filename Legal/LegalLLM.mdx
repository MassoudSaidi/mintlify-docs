**1. Legally Binding Agreement (Grant-Related)**

- This sample agreement is designed for use between government entities and organizations (nonprofit, for-profit, or districts) in the context of grant funding. It is highly specific, covering the obligations, payment terms, and legal enforceability related to a grant agreement. The template is adaptable for two-party or three-party arrangements and includes formal legal language, signature lines, and customizable sections for project-specific details[2](https://dlg.ky.gov/DLG%20Documents/Legally%20Binding%20Agreement%20\(Attachment%2011-03\).pdf).

  Each template is professionally formatted, includes essential legal sections (parties, terms, obligations, payment, signatures), and can be customized for particular use cases. These documents are available for immediate download as PDFs[3](https://www.jotform.com/pdf-templates/agreement).

**3. Legal Document Preparation Overview**

- The National Paralegal College provides an educational PDF outlining the basic types of legal documents, such as deeds, wills, mortgages, contracts, business documents (articles of incorporation, bylaws, partnership agreements), and trusts. While this is more of a teaching resource than a template, it offers professional examples and explanations of each document type[1](https://www.nationalparalegal.edu/Slides_New/Legal_Document_Prep/SH/Slides_01.pdf).

**4. Specialized Legal Training Materials**

- UNICEF offers a detailed training manual for lawyers and legal practitioners focused on child-friendly legal services. This PDF includes modules on children's rights, confidentiality, participation in legal proceedings, and privacy/data protection. It contains sample forms, evaluation templates, and other legal documentation relevant to child advocacy and protection law[4](https://www.unicef.org/eca/media/34161/file/Child-Friendly%20Legal%20Services:%20A%20training%20Manual%20for%20lawyers%20and%20other%20legal%20practitioners%20%20Facilitator%E2%80%99s%20Handbook.pdf).

## **Public Legal Datasets for AI Training**

- **Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD):**\
  CUAD is a widely used, publicly available dataset containing over 13,000 labels across 510 commercial legal contracts. These contracts, sourced from the U.S. SECâ€™s EDGAR system, are manually labeled to identify 41 types of important legal clauses. CUAD covers various contract types such as distributor agreements, license agreements, and more. The dataset is available for download and use in AI research and model training[2](https://www.genieai.co/blog/legal-ai-available-datasets)[4](https://huggingface.co/datasets/theatticusproject/cuad-qa).
- **Cambridge Law Corpus (CLC):**\
  The CLC offers a large-scale dataset of over 250,000 UK court cases, spanning from the 16th century to the present. The corpus includes raw text, metadata, and expert-annotated case outcomes for a subset of cases. It is designed for legal AI research and is available under certain restrictions for research purposes[3](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4763429).
- **ContractNLI:**\
  This is a dataset focused on document-level natural language inference in contracts, specifically non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). It is suitable for training models on contract understanding and inference tasks[2](https://www.genieai.co/blog/legal-ai-available-datasets).

## **Legal Agreement Templates for Data Use and AI Training**

- **AI Training Data Licence Agreement (Docular):**\
  Docular provides a professional template for an AI training data licence agreement. This document outlines the terms under which a dataset can be lawfully used for training AI models, including licensing, confidentiality, audit rights, payment, warranties, and limitations of liability. It is customizable and downloadable for direct use[1](https://docular.net/documents/template/6112/ai-training-data-licence-agreement).
- **Data Use Agreement for Open AI Model Development (Microsoft):**\
  Microsoft offers a comprehensive PDF template for data sharing agreements tailored to AI model development. This template covers project details, data description, licensing, data handling, retention, and security requirements, making it suitable for formalizing the legal aspects of AI training data use[5](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/msc/documents/presentations/CSR/DUA-OAI-1-1.pdf).

## **Additional Considerations**

- **Legal Compliance:**\
  When using or sharing legal documents for AI training, ensure compliance with relevant privacy and data protection laws such as GDPR, CCPA, and AI-specific regulations. Proper licensing and user notification may be required, especially if personal or copyrighted data is involved[6](https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/terms-conditions-privacy-policy-ai-training/).
